b) Report the estimated ATE (ˆ τ) and its statistical significance.

Interpretation:
	•	Intercept α = 95.97
	•	Treatment effect τ = −9.11
	•	Sustainability effect β = 1.51

Participating in the carbon offset program is associated with a 9.1-point decrease in stakeholder engagement, on average, after controlling for sustainability spending.

Since the p-value is very small (0.000), this effect is statistically significant at conventional levels.


c) Briefly explain under what assumptions ˆ τ can be given a causal interpretation.

The estimated treatment effect τ can be interpreted causally if the following assumptions hold:
	1.	Unconfoundedness: There are no unobserved factors that influence both treatment and outcome, after controlling for spending.
	2.	Overlap: All corporations had a chance to be either treated or untreated for all levels of spending.
	3.	SUTVA: Each corporation’s engagement score is only affected by its own treatment status.

if these are met, τ represents the Average Treatment Effect (ATE).
